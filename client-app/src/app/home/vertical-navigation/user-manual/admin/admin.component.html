    <h2 class="heading">Site Administration</h2>
    <p >The administration section of this website allows you to register new users (from a file or individually), update the permissions of users, upload courses
        to be used in Course Group Creation, and delete users.
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading">Registering Users</h3>
    <h5 class="subheading">Registering from a file</h5>
    <p>Users can be registered either from a file, for multiple users, or directly through a form, for individual users. When registering users
        from a file, it is important to make sure the file is in the correct format. The types of files this site is capable of registering users from
        are the same as the ones that can be downloaded from a Moodle course (see figure 1). Both .csv and .xlsx file types are acceptable. 
    </p>

    <p>To register uses from this file type, simply upload the file to the section labeled 'Register Users from File', click OK, and let 
        the system take care of the rest. When the accounts are created, the users will be sent an email informing them of the new account. Their
        usernames will be set as their email addresses and the default password will be there CWID. It is important to have the new users reset their password
        to ensure maximum account security.
    </p>
    <h5 class="subheading">Registering Individual Users</h5>
    <p>If, for some reason, you need to register an individual user, it may be easier to register them through a form instead of a file.
        To do this, fill out the form in the section labeled 'Register Individual User' with the appropriate information and click confirm. The user
        will be notified of their new account but you will need to inform of them of the password you set for them.
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading">Changing User Roles</h3>
    <p>User roles are important to this system. They determine what users can can't interact with. There are four roles: Admins, Faculty 
        Members, Moderators, and Students.
    </p>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Admins: The same permissions as you. Admins have full permissions on the system</li>
        <li>Faculty: Faculty members can do everything you can do except view/interact with the Administration section or Broadcast management Section</li>
        <li>Moderator: Moderators have the same permissions as students but with the ability to create groups. This is useful if you have a student, 
            such as a club officer, who may need to be able to create groups to share calendars/events or message other users.
        </li>
        <li>Student: Students are only able to confirm appointment slots but have the same calendar permissions as other users, with the exception
            that they can not share calendars or events to groups, since they do not have access to any groups.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>To update the role of any users, select the menu next to their name in the 'Change User Roles' section and choose their new
        role. You can reduce the number of users in the list by typing their name or email address into the search bar. The list will be automatically filtered
        to reflect your input. When you are happy with your changes, click OK. A popup will appear asking you to confirm the roles. If you are happy 
        with the changes, click confirm. If you want to make more changes, close the popup by clicking the 'x'. Your changes will be saved unless
        you overwrite them or refresh the page.
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading">Uploading Courses</h3>
    <p>To create groups for certain courses, the system needs to know which courses are available for which major. For now, a limited number of
        Computer Science courses are available. As the need for more courses grows, you can update the list of available courses for each major
        by uploading a file (see Figure 2) with the course information. Simply choose a major from the dropdown menu, upload the file, and submit it. The available 
        courses will then be available for Course Group creation.

    <h3 class="heading">
        Deleting Users
    </h3>
    <p>When a user leaves the University, it may become necessary to delete their account. This should only done if you are absolutely certain
        it is necessary, as it can not be undone. All the data associated with that user will be deleted. To delete user accounts, click the check box
        next to their name in the 'Delete Users' section. This list can be filtered in the same way as the list in the 'Update User Roles' section.
        When you are happy with your changes, click OK. A popup will open asking you to confirm. To finalize deleting the accounts, click Confirm. If 
        you want to make more changes, close the popup and continue. Your changes will be saved unless you overwrite them or refresh the page.
