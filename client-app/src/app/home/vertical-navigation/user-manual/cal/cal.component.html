    <h2 class="heading">Calendar</h2>
    <p>The calendar allows users to create events for themselves and others, create calendars to organize events, and displays appointments
        once they have been confirmed. When your account was created, three default calendars were created for you. You can add events to these 
        calendars if you wish, but you can not edit or delete them. The Appointment Calendar is where your appointments will go when you have confirmed them,
        the Shared Events calendar is where events that are shared to you will go, and the Main Calendar is just a default calendar that is there to
        give you a starting point. To the left of the calendar, you will see a maroon button labeled 'Create', a 'New Calendar' button, and two sections for calendars you have 
        created and calendars that have been shared with you. The two calendar sections can be collapsed, as well as the entire left sidebar, if desired. Clicking the check boxes next to any of the calendars will toggle their events in/out of
        the display. This is useful for reducing the number of events displayed, if there start to be too many. There are also navigation buttons at the top,
        along with buttons to change between Month, Week, Day, and List views.

    <h3 class="heading">Events</h3>
    <h4 class="subheading">Creating an Event</h4>
    <p>To create an event, click the maroon create button to the left of the calendar. You will be redirected to a form for event creation. 
        Fill in the information as desired, selecting which calendar you want the event to show up in. When everything is as you like, click confirm.
        You will be redirected back to the calendar and the event will show up. To view the details of the event, click it in the calendar and a popup will
        appear with all the information.

    <h4 class="subheading">Event Options</h4>
    <p>When you click an event to view its details, an options button will be available. If you created the event, you will be able to edit, delete, and share
        the event, as well as view people who have confirmed attendance to the event, if you shared it with anyone. If the event is one that was shared
        with you, you will only be able to confirm your attendance. It is important to note that appointments being displayed on the calendar will not
        have the options menu available.
    </p>
    <h4 class="subheading">Editing an Event</h4>
    <p>To edit an event, choose edit under the options menu. You will be redirected to the event creation page, but all the event's information
        will be filled in. You can change this information as you like, including adding or removing recipients, then click confirm. You will be 
        taken back to the calendar, and the event will be displayed with its newly updated information. 
    </p>
    <h4 class="subheading">Sharing an Event</h4>
    <p>If you wish to share an event that has already been created with other users, you can either edit the event as described above, or click on
        Share under the options menu. If you click on share under the menu, a popup will appear prompting you to enter emails of users. A button to
        select groups is also availble. Choosing select groups will open another popup with a list of groups available to you, select any number of groups
        from the list and the email addresses of the members will be added to the email field. You can add or remove email addresses as you like. When you
        are done, click Share. Users will now be able to view the event and confirm attendance. Note: If the group selection popup does not contain any groups,
        you have either not created any groups or do not have access to groups. If you believe this is a mistake, contact the system adminstrator. 
    </p>
    <h4 class="subheading">Deleting an Event</h4>
    <p>If you wish to delete an event, you can do so under the options menu. Click the delete button and a popup will appear asking you to confirm.
        If you click cancel, the popup will close and the event will not be deleted. If you click confirm, the event will be deleted. It will no longer 
        appear in your calendar or the calendars of anyone you've shared that event to. This can not be undone so make sure you are deleting the correct event.
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading">Calendars</h3>
    <p>Calendars are a great way to organize the way events show up in the calendar display. You can share these calendars with other users to 
        have a quick way of sharing events with them for viewing. 
    </p>
    <h4 class="subheading">Creating a Calendar</h4>
    <p>To create a calendar, click the 'New Calendar' button to the left of the calendar view. A popup will appear asking you to enter the calendar
        title and color, as well as users to share the calendar with. An option to select groups is also available. Fill the information in as desired
        and click save. The calendar will now be available for putting events into. Events created for that calendar will be shown with a border color
        of whatever color you chose for the calendar. Note: If the group selection popup does not contain any groups,
        you have either not created any groups or do not have access to groups. If you believe this is a mistake, contact the system adminstrator.

    <h4 class="subheading">Calendar Options</h4>
    <p>To edit, share, or delete calendars, hover your cursor over the calendar in the list you wish to update. An icon will appear if the calendar is one you crated and not one that was shared to you. Clicking the 
        icon will show a menu for editing, sharing, and deleting the calendar.
    </p>
    <h4 class="subheading">Sharing a Calendar</h4>
    <p>After a calendar has been created, you may wish to share it with other users so they can view the events. Users you have shared a calendar 
        with will not be able to confirm attendance for events on that calendar if you have not also shared the event with them. Sharing calendars is for 
        viewing access only. To share a calanedar, click share in the options menu. A popup will appear similar to the one you saw for sharing events.
    </p>
    <h4 class="subheading">Editing a Calendar</h4>
    <p>If you need to edit a calendar, you can do so by clicking edit in the options menu. A popup will appear similar to the calendar creation 
        popup but the calendar information will already be filled in. From here, you can change the calendar title, color, or add and remove recipients.
        Clicking save will update the calendar information with any changes you have made. Clicking cancel will not save any changes and will close the popup.
    </p>
    <h4 class="subheading">Deleting a Calendar</h4>
    <p>Deleting a calendar will remove it from the calendar displays of both yourself, and anyone who you have shared that calendar with. This can not
        be undone so you should make sure you are deleting the correct calendar. To delete a calendar, click delete in the options menu and click confirm
        in the popup that appears asking for your confirmation. Clicking cancel in the popup will not delete the calendar.
