    <h2 class="heading">Groups</h2>
    <p>Groups are a useful way to organize groups of users for sharing events/calendars and creating appointments. You can also message the members
        of a group to communicate with them. When you first navigate to the Groups page, you will see a list of you groups. Click any of them to
        view the deatils including the list of members.
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading">Creating a Group</h3>
    <p>To create a group, click the 'Create Group' button in the top left. A dropdown will appear with choices for custom or course groups.
        Choose the one you want to make and a form will appear.
    </p>
    <h4 class="subheading">Course Groups</h4>
    <p>Course groups are useful when you need to share things with students of a particular course, such as events or calendars. It is 
        important to note that created a course group will allow it to be viewed by all faculty members. Only you can edit or delete the group though.

    <h4 class="subheading">Custom Groups</h4>
    <p>Custom groups are best suited for organizing users based on some quality other than a course they are taking. For example, a group for your
        advisees would be useful when creating adivising appointments or a group for members of an organization would be useful in sharing events or 
        calendars.

    <h4 class="subheading">Creating from a file</h4>
    <p>If you have a larger number of users for which you wish to create a group, you can upload a file with their information. The system will
        automatically use that file to add them to your group. If the users in the file do not have accounts yet, those accounts will be created for them. Otherwise
        they will just be added to the group. The format of the file is the same as one you can download from a Moodle Course (see Figure 3). Both 
        .csv and .xlsx file types are acceptable.

        message the members of your group, you can do so by clicking share under the manage menu. A popup will appear prompting you to enter the 
        email addresses of the users you wish to share the group with. Click share and they will then have access to your group. Only you will
